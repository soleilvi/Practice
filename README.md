# Practice Files
A collection of exercises I have completed on LeetCode, HackerRank, and Advent of Code. All the solutions are my best attempts, without looking at other people's solutions.

## How to Use
The contents of the code files are meant to be copied and pasted into the corresponding exercise in either HackerRank or LeetCode. Each code file has the URL of its exercise at the top written as a comment. To get to its corresponding exercise, simply copy and paste the URL into your search bar. Then, copy and paste the code from the file.
